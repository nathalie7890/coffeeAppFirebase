Classic Coffee
1. Espresso
"The espresso, also known as a short black, is approximately 1 oz. of highly concentrated coffee.
Although simple in appearance, it can be difficult to master."

1 shot of espresso


2. Classic Red Eye
Red eye coffee is a coffee drink that combines drip coffee with one or two shots of espresso.
The name likely refers to taking a “red eye flight,” an airline flight that’s overnight, causing the passengers to have tired red eyes.

1 shot of espresso
6 oz. of drip-brewed coffee
Milk or cream(optional)

3. Americano
Americanos are popular breakfast drinks and thought to have originated during World War II.
Soldiers would add water to their coffee to extend their rations farther.
The water dilutes the espresso while still maintaining a high level of caffeine.

1 doubleshot espresso
1/2 cup ice and cold water
Use hot water and omit ice for hot Americano

4. Cortado
Combining a shot of espresso with an equal amount of warm, steamed milk,
the cortado is perfect for those who want to enjoy a shot of coffee but can’t quite handle its bitter kick alone.

1 shot of espresso
1 oz. of warm milk
1 cm of foam

5. Breve Latte
Caffè breve is an espresso-based drink that’s made like a cappuccino, but with steamed half-and-half instead of milk. This produces a very creamy foam.
1 shot of espresso
3 oz. of steamed half-and-half
1 cm of foam

6. Cappuccino
This creamy coffee drink is usually consumed at breakfast time in Italy and is loved in the United States as well.
It is usually associated with indulgence and comfort because of its thick foam layer and additional flavorings that can be added to it.

1-2 shots of espresso
2 oz. of steamed milk
2 oz. of foamed milk
sprinkling of chocolate powder (optional)

7.Cafe Latte
Cafe lattes are considered an introductory coffee drink since the acidity and bitterness of coffee are cut by the amount of milk in the beverage.
Flavoring syrups are often added to the latte for those who enjoy sweeter drinks.

1 shot of espresso
8-10 oz. of steamed milk +
1 cm of foam

8. Mocha
The mocha is considered a coffee and hot chocolate hybrid. The chocolate powder or syrup gives it a rich and creamy flavor and cuts the acidity of the espresso.

1 shot of espresso + 1-2 oz. of chocolate syrup/powder
1-3 oz. of steamed milk
2-3 cm of foam or whipped cream

9. Vienna
There are a few variations on the Vienna, but one of the most common is made with two ingredients: espresso and whipped cream.
The whipped cream takes the place of milk and sugar to provide a creamy texture.

1-2 shots of espresso
2 oz. of whipped cream

10. Affogato
Affogatos are more for a dessert coffee than a drink you would find at a cafe, but they can add a fun twist to your coffee menu.
They are made by pouring a shot of espresso over a scoop of vanilla ice cream to create a sweet after-meal treat.

1-2 shots of espresso
1 scoop of vanilla ice cream

11. Cafe au LaitThe cafe au lait is typically made with French press coffee instead of an espresso shot to bring out the different flavors in the coffee.
It is then paired with scalded milk instead of steamed milk and poured at a 50/50 ratio.

5 oz. French press coffee + 5 oz. scalded milk
